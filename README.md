# Zerodha Trade GPT

**Zerodha Trade GPT** is a real-time stock trading agent that connects **LLMs (Claude.ai)** with **Zerodha's Kite Connect API** using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and a TypeScript-based backend.

Through natural language commands like _"Buy 5 shares of INFY"_, LLMs can place actual stock trades via secure, live MCP tools (`buy-stock` and `sell-stock`).
